## Clean node modules

Cleaning the `node_modules` folder has several advantages. Firstly, it can help to free up disk space on your computer, especially if your project has a large number of dependencies. Second, it can help to resolve issues related to dependencies that may have become outdated or are no longer needed. Third, it can help to improve the performance of your project by reducing the number of files that need to be read and processed. Finally, it can also help to ensure that your project is using the most up-to-date and secure versions of dependencies. Overall, regularly cleaning this folder is a good practice that can help to keep your project running smoothly.

```bash
rm -rf node_modules/
```
